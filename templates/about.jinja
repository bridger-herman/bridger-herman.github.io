  Hello! I'm Bridger, a Computer Science PhD student at the University of
  Minnesota.

  I am interested in using computers and visualization to help people
  solve the world's largest problems. Understanding problems is always the
  first step in solving them, and often one of the best ways to understand
  a problem is to visualize it. Computers are an extremely useful tool for
  helping to create meaningful graphics out of the massive amounts of data
  generated by various scientific fields today. Visual computing and
  visualization come together at the intersection of science and art,
  forming a powerful combination that can help people comprehend and solve
  problems with meaningful results.
