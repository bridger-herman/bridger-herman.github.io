  Hello! I'm Bridger (<a
  href="https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/diversity-inclusion/pronouns">pronouns</a>
  he/him/his), a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Minnesota.
</p>

<p class="fiftypercent">
  I'm currently working in the Interactive Visualization Lab here at the U,
  working on creating user interfaces to bridge the gap in between art and
  science. I've also done lots of work in <a href="http://dataphys.org">data
  physicalization</a>, the study of tangible representations of data. Both
  our visual and tactile senses are indispensible in understanding the
  massive amounts of data generated by various scientific fields today, and
  in order to produce the best visualizations, we need to rely on those with
  visual expertise &ndash; artists!

  When I'm not working in the lab (or working remotely on lab-related stuff),
  you can usually find me outside. I enjoy running, cycling, hiking, skiing,
  and many other outdoor activities. I am also involved in the Minnesota
  Brass drum corps as a front ensemble instructor and fleet manager.
