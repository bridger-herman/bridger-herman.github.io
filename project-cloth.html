  <h1>Cloth Simulation</h1>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    The aim of this project is to simulate cloth, using Hooke's Law spring
    systems. So far, only vertical springs have been created, with a
    wireframe representing the locations of nodes and links in the
    system.
  </p>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    So far, the largest challenges of this project have been determining
    if the simulation is "correct" or not. With the first part of the
    simulation, I made the mistake of not taking into account forces from
    all directions on nodes, which resulted in the springs not responding
    to forces in physically realistic ways.
  </p>

  <h3>Controls</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>WASD/Mouse:</strong> Camera control</li>
    <li><strong>Arrow keys:</strong> Move anchored nodes (top nodes) around</li>
    <li><strong>Z/X:</strong> Decrease/Increase spring constant</li>
    <li><strong>C/V:</strong> Decrease/Increase damping constant</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
  <p>
    So far, only linear springs are implemented. There is a list of nodes,
    and each node has a "link" connecting it with other nodes. Forces are
    applied on a Node-by-Node basis.

  <h3>Code</h3>
  <p>
    Code from this project can be found in <a
    href="https://github.umn.edu/herma582/5611-hw2">this GitHub repo</a>. <br>

    The code is written in C++ and makes use of the following external libraries:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenGL 3.3 API:</strong> Graphics</li>
      <li><strong>SDL2:</strong> Window management</li>
      <li><strong>GLM:</strong> Matrix/Vector mathematics</li>
      <li><strong>stb_image:</strong> Loading image textures</li>
    </ul>
