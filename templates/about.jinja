  Hello! I'm Bridger (<a
  href="https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/diversity-inclusion/pronouns">pronouns</a>
  he/him/his), a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Minnesota.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently working in the Interactive Visualization Lab here at the U,
  working on creating user interfaces to bridge the gap in between art and
  science. I'm presently using a combination of web-based, augmented reality,
  and virtual reality technologies to accomplish this. I've also done lots of
  work in <a href="http://dataphys.org">data physicalization</a>, the study
  of tangible representations of data. Both our visual and tactile senses are
  indispensible in understanding the massive amounts of data generated by
  various scientific fields today, and in order to produce the best
  visualizations, we need to rely on those with visual expertise &ndash;
  artists!
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not working in the lab (or working remotely on lab-related stuff),
  you can usually find me outside. I enjoy running, cycling, hiking, skiing,
  and many other outdoor activities. I am also involved in the Minnesota
  Brass drum corps as a front ensemble instructor and fleet manager.
</p>

<p>
  I am passionate about
