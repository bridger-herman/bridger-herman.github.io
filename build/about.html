Hey, I'm Bridger, a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of
Minnesota.

</p>




<p class="m-2 my-4">

I'm currently on the job market seeking a research-oriented position in the
extended reality field. Send me an (email) to get in touch!

</p>




<p class="m-2 my-4">

My current work bridges the gap between physical and digital spaces using a
combination of extended reality and digital fabrication technologies.
Specifically, I build creative extended reality visualization solutions to make
multivariate spatial or spatiotemporal data more graspable: both more
comprehensible and more tactile.

</p>




<p class="m-2 my-4">

Besides my research, I have a passion for teaching. In my graduate career, I've
been an instructor and co-instructor for multiple classes, and have been a
teaching assistant most other semesters. Now more than ever, it's important for
individuals to be informed about the inner computational workings of the
technologies our society depends on.

</p>




<p class="m-2 my-4">

When I'm not in the lab or teaching, you can usually find me adventuring
outside. I enjoy running, cycling, hiking, skiing, rock climbing, and many other
outdoor activities. I have also volunteered for the (Minnesota Brass) drum corps
as a board member, percussion instructor, and transportation coordinator.

</p>
