      <p>
        Hello! My name is Bridger Herman. I am a Computer Science major at the
        University of Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in using computers to help people, and to help the
        environment. I belive computers are an extremely powerful tool for
        helping people understand the world around them, and to aid in
        decision-making processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about the outdoors, about my work, and about spreading
        knowledge.

        Oftentimes when I'm out experiencing nature, I will bring my camera with
        me. Below are some albums of the photos I've taken.

            From February 2017 to July 2017, I studied abroad at the University
            of Auckland, in New Zealand. This album contains some of the
            pictures I took while I was there.

      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to do various projects for fun. Sometimes they
        don't get very far, but it's still fun to try.
