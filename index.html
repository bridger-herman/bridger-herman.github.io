  <h1>Multi-Agent Motion Planning</h1>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Motion planning for agents in a virtual world
  </p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Realtime, 3D rendering</li>
    <li>3D user controlled camera</li>
    <li>Realtime user interaction with system</li>
    <li>Probabilistic road map (PRM)</li>
    <li>A* Search</li>
    <li>Boids flocking simulation</li>
    <li>3D scenes</li>
    <li>Path smoothing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    The largest challenges in this project included creating the A* search
    algorithm, and tuning the parameters to make Boids look good. An additional
    challenge was figuring out if navigation should be done on a flock level, or
    on an individual agent level. Since each agent plans for itself, it's
    possible that the planning graphs for agents in the flock will differ,
    resulting in a badly behaving simulation where the agents move through
    obstacles.
  </p>

  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>WASD/Mouse:</strong> Camera control</li>
    <li><strong>g:</strong> Start/stop flock motion</li>
    <li><strong>h:</strong> Hide/show planning graphs for agents</li>
    <li><strong>r:</strong> Reset the simulation (need to press
        <strong>g</strong> again)</li>
    <li><strong>1-4:</strong> Select which flock force to adjust</li>
    <li><strong>z/x:</strong> Decrease/increase selected flock force</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
    <h4>Setup</h4>
      When the program is first run, the following steps occur:
      <ol>
        <li>Generate scene meshes (ground plane and obstacles)</li>
        <li>Create map with obstacles</li>
        <li>Initialize PRM from map</li>
        <li>Initialize flock and send planning graph to all agents</li>
        <li>Path-plan using A* or UCS</li>
      </ol>
    <h4>At each timestep</h4>
      At each timestep while the program is running, the following steps occur:
      <ol>
        <li>Update agent forces (goal-seeking and collision-avoidance)</li>
        <li>Update agent accelerations, velocities, and positions</li>
        <li>Determine all agents' next incremental goal</li>
        <li>Calculate new flock centroid based on agents' positions</li>
        <li>Update flock forces (Cohesive, Alignment, Separation)</li>
        <li>Render scene</li>
      </ol>

  <h3>Graph</h3>
  <p>
    Graphs are represented as a list of nodes, each with a location, a list of
    nodes that they are connected to, and the associated costs for each node.
    The graph handles all adding and removing of nodes, and connecting the nodes
    within the graph in a manner that does not intersect any obstacles
  </p>

  <h3>Probabilistic Road Map (PRM)</h3>
  <p>
    The PRM generates random locations within the dimensions of the map it is
    given, and populates a new graph with nodes at those locations. Every time
    the map is reset (when the user presses <strong>r</strong>), a new PRM is
    generated.
  </p>

  <h3>A* Search</h3>
  <p>
    A* search takes the graph generated by the PRM and returns a path from the
    start to the goal of a particular agent. The heuristic used by the
    algorithm is the straight-line distance from the current node to the goal
    node. This is an admissable heuristic because straight-line distance is
    always the shortest possible path between any two points.
  </p>

  <p>
    Compared with Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* is much faster (see Figure 1).
    However, A* seemed to perform slightly worse from a path-length perspective,
    as shown in Figure 2. Data were obtained using a ten trials of a PRM graph
    with 125 nodes.
  </p>

  <h3>Boids</h3>
  <p>
    The Boids algorithm for multi-agent interactions is used in this project. In
    this particular implementation, there are five forces acting on each Boid
    agent:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cohesive:</strong> Seek the centroid of the flock. The vector
    betwee the flock centroid and the Boid's current location is calculated, and
    that directly becomes the cohesive force.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Separation:</strong> Go away from closest neighbors. Sometimes this
    force resulted in the flock being squashed into a line, so an additional
    component was added that constrains the flock's stretch in any particular
    direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Alignment:</strong> Try to stay aligned with closest neighbors
    using velocity. Currently just uses the average velocity of the entire
    flock, and it seems to work fine.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Goal:</strong> Try to go towards next incremental goal
    (furthest visible node). At each timestep, each Boid tries to find the
    node along its planned path that is farthest from its current position, and
    closest to the goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Obstacle-avoiding:</strong> Try to avoid every obstacle. The
    distance from the center of every obstacle to the Boid's current position is
    calculated, which directly becomes the force acting on the Boid.
  </p>
